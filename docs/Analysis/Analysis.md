# Microdomain Analysis


The analysis consists of two steps: Hotspot detection and dartboard visualization. It is based on Diercks et al. 2019. 

During the hotspot detection, information about the Calcium Microdomains in each cell of interest and each time frame such as the localization, time of occurrence and size are being measured. After that, the microdomains can be assigend to different areas in a virtual dartboard. This allows to create various dartboards for different time spans and cells.
