# **Getting Started**

This program was designed to facilitate postprocessing and analysis of live cell fluorescence microscopy imaging data.
It is meant primarily as a tool for experimentalists. 
We have included a graphical user interface (GUI) to make usage as easy as possible, but the installation process 
is at the moment still only possible by downloading the code and installing the necessary packages. 


For further support or issues regarding installation, feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/IPMI-ICNS-UKE/DARTS/issues) or contact us directly.
